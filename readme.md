# Python Kraken API interface

Contains the most common requests that one would need to use to interact with Kraken.

I planned on modeling the responses, and creating a sandbox server, but it seems unlikely to happen, considering the significant downtime of Kraken's API servers and significant API instability.

Please don't trust Kraken with your crypto assets or FIAT funds.

Find a real custodial account or use cold storage.

Kraken owns all of the funds you have in your account, you own nothing.
